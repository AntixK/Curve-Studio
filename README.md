# Squirrel Curve Studio 

Squirrel Curve Studio is an intuitive easy-to-use app for creating beautiful spline curves (free-form curves). Motivated by the lack of freely available curve designers, Squirrel provides a clean UI for designing, exporting and importing free-form curves.

## For Developers [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues)
I welcome pull-requests for any new functionality or improving the app's experience overall. I am currently looking towards decreasing the app size using Neutralino.js.
